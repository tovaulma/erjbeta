# emotionrecognitionjournalapp
This was an Android app that I created for my IB CS IA.
I used Microsoft Azure Face Recognition API for the emotion recognition feature.
You may use the app for non-commerical purposes.

You will have to import this into Android Studio and export it as an APK file, in order to install it on your Android phone.
